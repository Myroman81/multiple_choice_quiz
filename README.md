# multiple_choice_quiz

##  This challenge involved creating a multiple choice quiz with a timer that deducts seconds after each incorrect response and logs for both high scores and the initials of the test taker.  Unfortunately only a fraction of requirements have been met.  This was by far the most challenging project yet and I will try to use it as motivation to grow as a developer slowly but surely.  Projects like these are quite humbling and show how far I will have to go to become comfortable with the learning process.  

##  Ideally once the start quiz button is clicked it disappears along with the rules for the quiz.  At one point with the help of my tutor Erik Hoversten, we had the questions appearing with multiple choice answers but for some reason when I tried to finish the project I took a step back and created other problems that weakened the finished product.

## Collaborators include Leif Hetland, Fred Kamm, my classmates, and aforementioned tutor, Erik.
